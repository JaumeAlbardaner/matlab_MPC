# matlab_MPC
Repository of MATLAB files that were created for the sole purpose of understanding how Model Predictive Control (MPC) works.

The first files only include variable steering, and the latter ones include variations in speed too.
In order to make the simulated vehicle follow the desired trajectory, principles from the Model Predictive Path Integral control (MPPI) algorithm were implemented.
